# FaM-SAM
Repository for Fast Medical SAM (FaM-SAM).
Consists of Notebooks and datasets links for the results in the document.

Selected Datasets:
* https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/covid19-ct-scans
* https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database
* https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashutoshnaik67/hovernetdataset
* https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/tia/data/glascontest/

Inference Models:
* Fast-SAM
* SAM
* Med-SAM

We create extrapolation from the results of the Fast-SAM and Med-SAM performance on these medical segmentation datasets and implement these to show contrast form the Vanilla Segment Anything Model. The conclusion led to the formation of Fast Medical SAM.(FaM-SAM)
